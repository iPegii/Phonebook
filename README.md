First project with complete fullstack (frontend - backend - database)

Done as part of the Fullstack course in university:

Frontend - React

Backend - Node.js & Express

Database - MongoDB

App can be found from: https://pegiappi.herokuapp.com/

If you want to try the code yourself:

1. npm install - installs the correct packages
2. create file .env to the root folder (folder that contains folders of frontend and requests). To .env file add "PORT=3001"
 and MONGODB_URI= (contains the 'Connection String Only'-format of MongoDB)
3. npm run watch - runs the project
